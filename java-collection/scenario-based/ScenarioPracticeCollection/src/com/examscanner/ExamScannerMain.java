/*
5. ExamScanner – Digital Answer Sheet Validator
Story: In a school, multiple-choice answer sheets are scanned and saved as .csv files. Each
line looks like:
John Doe,A,B,C,D,A,B,C
ExamScanner should:
● Read each line and parse student answers using BufferedReader
● Compare answers with a provided answer key
● Use Generics to work with different subject types (MathAnswerSheet,
ScienceAnswerSheet)
● Use Map<StudentName, Score>, and sort results using a PriorityQueue
● Detect formatting issues using Regex (e.g., extra/missing commas, invalid options)
